# AI-Powered Poetry Generator

This is a web application that generates unique poems based on user prompts. The project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, API integration, and user interface design.

## Key Features

Natural Language Processing: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to generate creative and contextually relevant poetry based on a user's prompt.

Dynamic Content: The application fetches and displays a new poem with each request, providing a fresh experience.

Interactive UI: A clean, user-friendly interface built with React that allows users to input prompts and view generated content seamlessly.

## How to Use

Enter a Poet's Name: Type the name of a poet, writer, or artist whose style you want the poem to be in.

Press Enter: Once you've typed the name, press the "Enter" key on your keyboard to generate the poem.

Wait for the Magic: The application will process your request. A poem should appear in a minute.
